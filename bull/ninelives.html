            <p>In 2016 a movie came out known as Nine Lives, the movie featured quite a few notable actors, was made on
                a 30 million dollar budget, featured Kevin Spacey as the main actor (just a year before his teen
                touching habits were exposed), and is the only movie I know of where the wikipedia article immediately
                says it was known for being unoriginal and unfunny. It's notable for being yet another movie where the
                main character is a cgi animal (although it's worth noting this one was especially bad and terribly
                animated) and for intense scenes where characters literally fall off buildings, despite being obviously
                marketed towards kids. The humor is incredibly dry, essentially all being cat puns and similar jokes. I
                got more of a rise out of not a single person in the theater laughing at all than any joke in the movie.
                This movie is something that really stuck with me because of how genuinely bad it is, generic boring
                story, terrible attempts at comedy, lackluster acting, and an overall terrible experience. Watching the
                trailers for this movie tells you everything you need to know, in all the worst possible ways.</p>
            <p>

                The movie's plot is incredibly bland, Kevin Spacey plays a businessman named Tom Brand who is focused on
                his job more than his family (what a subtle last name), but his family wishes he would spend more time
                with them. Tom has a rival who wants to make his new building bigger than Tom's, they have a building
                measuring contest together, not related to what the business does or how its handled, it's all just
                based on size. While Tom heads home he gets a cat for his daughter's birthday. Tom heads to the rival
                building to check it out, has an argument with a manager there, and thanks to a nearby lightning strike,
                he falls off the building and ends up surviving, but in a coma. However, his consciousness is in the cat
                he bought, he is told by the mysterious owner of the pet shop that he has to get along with his family
                as the cat, and convince them he's Tom. The rest of the movie is all bland shenanigans you've seen
                before, with the generic happy ending you expect from it.
