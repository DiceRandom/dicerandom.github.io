        <p>In 2019 Disney studios reimagined the animated classic Aladdin. In this live action film the audience gets to
            relive the magic of Aladdin in a whole new way. This movie turned Broadway musical was filmed in the Wadi
            Rum Desert in Jordan for the desert scenes, but the majority of the movie was filmed in Longcross Studios in
            Surrey (UK). Aladdin was written by Guy Ritchie and John August, directed by Guy Ritche.</p>
        <p>
            In the story that takes place in the kingdom of Agrabah, Aladdin a street criminal and his monkey sidekick
            meet princess Jasmine. Aladdin falls in love with her but is not a prince so he can not be with her. Aladdin
            attempts to visit her at the palace and he does but is caught by the Sultan assistant Jafar. Jafar makes
            Aladdin go into a cave of buried treasure to find him a lamp but Aladdin ends up becoming trapped in the
            cave. When Aladdin rubs the lamp a Genie pops out to grant his wishes and help him be with the princess.
            Jafar tries to take over the kingdom but Aladdin and the genie work together to stop him.

            The acting in the movie was phenomenal. The characters' emotions were palpable. The audience truly felt
            every emotion that the character went through. Seeing this live action remake as opposed to the animated
            film allows people to feel more connected as it is more personable. The script itself has been changed from
            the original animated film from 1992. In this live action remake new characters were added like Jasmine's
            handmaid. New songs were also allowed like Jasmine's power ballad “Speechless”, this song along with some
            new writing makes Jasmin a 3-dimensional character. In this film there is an underlying message of female
            empowerment from Jasmine. However some of the choices with the Genie were questionable. In this version the
            Genie falls in love with Jasmine's handmaid but in the original film the Genie did not have a love interest.
            The genie also had some modified jokes.

            The costumes were magnificent. They provided so much color and character into the movie. The costumes and
            makeup helped to define the scenery. The set while most of it developed using CGI technology was incredible
            to look at. The musical is extremely catchy, with most songs having an upbeat tempo they are guaranteed to
            get stuck in a person's head.

            All in all, nothing can replace the original animated film but this movie has brought new life to the story.
            This is a perfect movie for the whole family to watch as it applies to all ages. The audio and visual
            aspects of this movie were outstanding. The movie deserves a horns up!
