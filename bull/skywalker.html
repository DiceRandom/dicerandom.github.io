                This movie can be considered both a Bulls Horns Up and a Bulls Horns Down. Why this is the case is due
                to the nature of the film. If it is your first time watching a Star Wars movie then you will certainly
                gain interest in the other movies and become a fan. If you are a current Star Wars fan you will be
                disappointed to a great extent. I’ll reiterate, if you enjoy an action, slightly comic, sci-fi, movie
                and know little to nothing about Star Wars you will love it and end up watching all of the movies. If
                you are a die hard fan of the movies then it will just look sad. It’s a poor excuse as a final movie in
                a fantastic series. With multiple plot holes, magically skipping necessary travel points/interactions,
                gaining knowledge that wouldn’t have been gained without actual action, and many other inconsistencies
                make this movie almost comical to watch/ J.J. Abrams does such a poor job that it’s almost, almost,
                good. Yet, it falls very short. As the final movie it deserved to be longer, have more actual
                connectivity, and overall with more effort and time I believe that it would have been something
                spectacular.

            <p>As far as the plot goes for the movie, it honestly is a jumpy mess. Little to no information is given
                about any of the locations which the film shows. Starting with Kylo Ren getting some crystal, which an
                hour later we find out is some “holofinder” which is how Rey will reach the new home of her Grandfather
                who's actually Emperor Palpatine, you see a whole 0.5 seconds of Rey using lightning powers. All while
                the true conflict in the movie really is not the big battle at the end of it, but rather an Inner
                conflict within Rey. This inner conflict is Palpatine trying to bring Rey to the dark side, same with
                Kylo Ren until he realizes that he is still Ben Solo and is actually on the Light Side. It was horrible
                to interpret. In the end of it all Rey renounces the name Palpatine and takes the name Skywalker
                instead. Also worth mentioning that Ben and Rey kiss for literally no reason at all. Plus throughout the
                whole movie there's something that Finn wants to tell Rey, yet he literally never does throughout the
                entire almost 2 and a half hour movie. I don’t know if I have a severe lack of misunderstanding, but
                whatever Finn had to say to Rey it was stressed through most of the movie. Something like that was
                completely overlooked in the end and the main focus was put on action and sci-fi effects rather than
                telling a complete, decent story.
