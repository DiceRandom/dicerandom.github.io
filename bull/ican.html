            <p>As a fan of horror movies, I was excited to see It Comes At Night available for viewing on Netflix. I
                remember hearing about it in 2017, the year of it’s release, but never actually seeing it in theaters.
                Watching the trailer made me excited and sold me on the idea of spending 91 minutes of my life on this
                movie. After watching it, I can say that I have never wasted 91 minutes of my life more than on this
                movie. I am all for abstract concepts and messages in movies, but if your audience leaves the film
                asking “..what was the point of that?” your messages were lost somewhere in the film. A lot of the issue
                comes in the advertising- with the way the trailer is set up, it makes viewers anticipate a classic
                horror flick, with constant fright, scary monsters and a fast pace, which the movie itself had none of.
                This false advertising also gives viewers false expectations, which adds to the distaste of this movie.
                If it was portrayed as a slow burn, subtle film with commentary about society, then I would be less
                annoyed sitting through it. However, with the expectations set, the viewing experience was just boring.
                It Comes At Night severely lacks context for its apocalyptic world, which MAY add to the mystery and
                suspense of it, but it only adds to the confusion and frusteration, because how the characeters act is
                because of their apocalyptic world, which has no explnantion. Why are they wearing masks? Are there
                zombies or some kind of creature roaming around? Where are they?? Why are food supplies limited?
                Removing some context is a helpful tool in the genre of suspense, but having no context ruins the
                structure of this movie- if there was any structure to begin with. Although film nerds rave about the
                strong commentary on humans and… how we act in an apocalypse? How we treat our neighbors? The message
                gets lost in the movie, because the viewers are confused or bored to death. The scariest part about It
                Comes At Night was the fact that I sat through the entire thing. It’s a big Horns Down from me- only
                watch this movie if you ran out of paint to watch drying.</p>
