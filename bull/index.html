            Going into my viewing of The Double, I tried to keep details about the film reasonably
            scarce, so as not to spoil it. I even refrained from watching any trailers for the film, limiting my
            knowledge to four descriptors of the film: a sentence-long, unspecific blurb about it following a
            generic Google search, its 83% critics’ approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Jesse Eisenberg’s
            starring role in the film, and its role as Richard Ayoade’s second directorial effort. What I
            originally thought to be the most significant background information on the film in my arsenal
            was my having previously seen Ayoade’s directorial debut, a teen-oriente..</p>

            In 2016 a movie came out known as Nine Lives, the movie featured quite a few notable actors, was made on a
            30 million dollar budget, featured Kevin Spacey as the main actor (just a year before his teen touching
            habits were exposed), and is the only movie I know of where the wikipedia article immediately says it was
            known for being unoriginal and unfunny. It's notable for being yet another movie where the main character is
            a cgi animal (although it's worth noting this one was especially bad and terribly animated) and for intense
            scenes where characters literally fall off...

            This movie can be considered both a Bulls Horns Up and a Bulls Horns Down. Why this is the case is due
                to the nature of the film. If it is your first time watching a Star Wars movie then you will certainly
                gain interest in the other movies and become a fan. If you are a current Star Wars fan you will be
                disappointed to a great extent. I’ll reiterate, if you enjoy an action, slightly comic, sci-fi, movie
                and know little to nothing about Star Wars you will love it and end up watching all of the movies. If
                you are a die hard fan of the movies then it will just look sad. It’s a poor excuse as a final movie in
                a fantastic series. With multiple....
