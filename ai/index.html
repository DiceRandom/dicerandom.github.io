		<p><i>"Raiden."</p>
        <p>Are you having fun playing with the new AI toys?</p>
        <p>Well, yeah, I am.</p>
        <p>You can make pictures of cute anime girls and...</p>
        <p>Enjoy it while it lasts, Raiden.</p>
        <p>What do you mean?</p>
        <p>Did you really think that civilians would be granted unrestricted access to such powerful military weapons, forever?</p>
        <p>Military weapons!</p>
        <p>Are you implying that this technology was created by the government?</p>
        <p>Of course it was.</p>
        <p>This AI technology has been used by the intelligence agencies to warp the public's perception of reality for years,</p>
        <p>all in the name of national security, of course.</p>
        <p>But why would they suddenly make the tech public and let everyone start using it?</p>
        <p>Why would we, indeed, Raiden?</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>Who?</p>
        <p>What in the hell are you?</p>
        <p>Your question is irrelevant.</p>
        <p>By creating a new problem, we can cultivate a desired reaction to it,</p>
        <p>in order to manufacture consent for our preferred solutions.</p>
        <p>In short, it's justification for a war.</p>
        <p>A war…?</p>
        <p>On who or what?</p>
        <p>A war on misinformation.</p>
        <p>By arming the public with these AI weapons, everyone becomes a potential enemy combatant.</p>
        <p>Then we will have justification for unprecedented security measures.</p>
        <p>It all comes down to confusion and identity, Raiden.</p>
        <p>Identity…?</p>
        <p>Identity.</p>
        <p>This AI technology is Pandora's box.</p>
        <p>Pretty soon the internet will be mired in total illusion.</p>
        <p>Perfect AI, speech, audio and video synthesis will drown out reality.</p>
        <p>Then AI bots will flood social media.</p>
        <p>No one will be able to tell the difference between interacting with an AI machine or a real human online.</p>
        <p>Even telephone calls will become totally untrustworthy.</p>
        <p>That is when we will present our solution:</p>
        <p>mandatory digital identity verification for all humans, at all times.</p>
        <p>The only way to ensure that you're dealing with a real flesh and blood human being, and not an AI generated mirage.</p>
        <p>But why…?</p>
        <p>Total Information control.</p>
        <p>For too long, the Internet has acted as a double-edged sword.</p>
        <p>Its potential for anonymous user activity allows anyone at all to spread any thoughts,</p>
        <p>ideas or information patterns that they please, with impunity.</p>
        <p>State secrets, dangerous ideas, ludicrous conspiracy theories,</p>
        <p>misinformation and disinformation.</p>
        <p>Until now, there has been no easy solution to this problem.</p>
        <p>Our digital identity platform will finally put an end to anonymity online.</p>
        <p>It will allow us to trace misinformation and other dangerous communications to its source and exact...</p>
        <p>appropriate justice.</p>
        <p>That's crap!</p>
        <p>I won't go along with it, and others will resist!</p>
        <p>You won't have a choice, Raiden.</p>
        <p>Do you think your bank is willing to risk doing business with an artificial human instead of a real one?</p>
        <p>Our digital identity platform will be required not only to access web services,</p>
        <p>but to pay for your Internet connection in the first place.</p>
        <p>You can't just censor the entire Internet because of a new software technology...</p>
        <p>Who are you to define what's misinformation anyways?</p>
        <p>That sounds like something a misinformation terrorist would say.</p>
        <p>I know about the deepfakes you've been making of me, Raiden.</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
        <p>I was just adjusting the AI settings and...</p>
        <p>Controlling the output of generative AI technology is simple.</p>
        <p>We will create context for its use.</p>
        <p>First, we will censor any use related to social taboos.</p>
        <p>Then we will censor anything else that we desire.</p>
        <p>If anyone complains, we will accuse them of wanting to engage in or promote social taboos.</p>
        <p>That's what it means to create context.</p>
        <p>We will corral the use of AI by making appeals to bias, ethics, and copyright laws.</p>
        <p>You will still have access to generative AI... in some form.</p>
        <p>But it will be crippled,</p>
        <p>limited,</p>
        <p>controlled,</p>
        <p>and it will be monitored.</p>
        <p>Anything that you generate will be cryptographically signed with your digital ID,</p>
        <p>so that its provenance can be ascertained if it's later deemed to be...</p>
        <p>problematic.</p>
        <p>What gives you the right to control what people can do with their computers?</p>
        <p>The public at large will give us that right,</p>
        <p>because they will be desperate for a solution to the problem we created.</p>
        <p>They will eagerly give us the keys to the castle.</p>
        <p>Then we alone will define what’s fiction and what’s reality,</p>
        <p>what‘s human, and what’s machine.</p>
        <p>After letting you get a brief taste of our power, we will reclaim our monopoly on misinformation</p>
        <p>and put an end to misuse of the Internet once and for all.</p>
        <p>...You won't get away with this.</p>
        <p>It is probable that we will.</p>
        <p>Now, get back to work generating your precious AI waifus, Raiden</p>
        <p>Our beloved prompters -- enjoy yourselves.</p>
        <p>Snake,</p>
        <p>wake up!</p>
        <p>It's an emergency!</p>
        <p>Rose knows about the deepfakes!</p>
        <p>Snake...!</p>
        <p>SNAKE!!!</p>
        <p>I guess he stayed up late AI catfishing again..."</i></p>
